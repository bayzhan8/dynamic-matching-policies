# Dynamic Matching Policies

Dynamic matching in kidney exchange specifically addresses the challenge of incompatible patient-donor pairs within a transplant network. This method involves creating a pool of such pairs and using sophisticated algorithms to identify complex chains or cycles of exchanges, allowing patients to receive kidneys from donors with whom they are compatible. The "dynamic" aspect refers to the system's ability to adapt and reconfigure matches as new pairs enter the pool or as existing circumstances change, thereby increasing the overall number of successful transplants and reducing waiting times for patients with otherwise incompatible donors.
